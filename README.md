In this, I used ProtonVPN Free to test how VPNs protect online privacy. I connected to a free server (Netherlands), verified that my IP address changed, and ensured that websites were loading securely.

I confirmed the encryption by checking the “https” in the browser and saw that my IP location had shifted to a different country. I also noticed a slight drop in speed, which is normal with free VPNs.

This task showed me how VPNs help hide my identity, encrypt traffic, and prevent tracking — but also reminded me that free VPNs may have speed or server limitations.
